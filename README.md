# RTS Multiplayer Prototype

This is a learning exercise to learn how to build an RTS-style game using the Unity engine.  This uses the Unity *Unet* networking system, which does not utilize a lockstep networking model like most robust RTS engines.

## Features 
* RTS style mouse controls :
  * Drag-select
  * Click-select
  * Right-click to move/attack
  * Attack + move
* Server-authoritative control, even for the "host" player
* Networked object pooling
